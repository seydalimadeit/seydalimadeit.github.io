I started web development at the age of 15 (2017). I worked as a freelancer making static websites based on html/css/js(jquery). A year later, I started mastering Node.js, learned how to develop simple API. After a while, I mastered VueJS and delved into modern web development.

---

Today I am engaged in full-stack development of web applications and microservices. I have commercial development experience. I implement cool features of varying degrees of complexity.

---

My development experience covers a wide range of technologies, including front-end (javascript, typescript, Vue.js, Nuxt.js), styling (CSS3, SCSS, SASS, BEM), back-end development (Node.js, Nest.js, Postgres, TypeORM), markup (HTML5, Markdown), testing (Jest, Cypress), code quality (ESLint, Prettier) and version control (Git, GitLab, GitHub)

---

I also have experience with Agile methodologies (Scrum, Kanban), tools like Figma. I am also skilled in package management (npm, yarn).

---

Participated in several hackathons, won prizes.

---

I also study at Igor Sikorsky Kyiv Polytechnic Institute with a degree in Computer Engineering

---

Ready for new challenges and interesting tasks. Interested in professional growth and learning opportunities!
